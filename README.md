*** SCRUM DEFINITION

lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value throught adaptive solutions for complex problems.

1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog
2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint
4. Repeat

Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvments can be made.

*** SCRUM THEORY

Scrum is founded on empiricsm and lean thinking

Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk

Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed

**** SCRUM PILLARS
		
		- TRANSPARENCY : The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work.

		- INSPECTION : The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems.

		- ADAPTATION : If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

**** SCRUM VALUES 

	- Commitment : the team commits to achieve its goals and to support each other
	- Focus : primary focus on the work of the Sprint
	- Openness : the team and it's stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges
	- Respect : the team respect each other to be capable
	- Courage : the team have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems

**** SCRUM TEAM

	The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people, it consist of : 
		- one Scrum Master
		- one Product Owner
		- Developers
	no sub-teams or hierarchies.
	
-Scrum Team are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint
-Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint
-Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities 

	** DEVELOPERS

	The Developers are always accountable for : 
		- Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog
		- Installing quality by adhering to a Definition of Done
		- Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal
		- Holding each other accountable as professionals

	** PRODUCT OWNER

	The PO is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team

	The PO is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes : 
		- Developing and explictly communicating the Product Goal;
		- Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
		- Ordering Product Backlog items
		- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood

	- The PO may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable
	- The PO is one person, not a committee
	- The PO may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog

	** SCRUM MASTER

	The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide.
	The Scrum Master help everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization
	The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team's effectiveness

	The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including: 
		- Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionnality
		- Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done
		- Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team's progress
		- Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive and kept within the timebox

	The Scrum Master servers the Product Owner in several ways, including: 
		- Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management
		- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
		- Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment
		- Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed

	The Scrum Master servers the organization in several ways, including: 
		- Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
		- Planning and advising Scrum implementations withing the organization
		- Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work
		- Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams

**** SCRUM EVENTS
	
	Events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum

	** THE SPRINT

	They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency
	A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint

	During the Sprint : 
		- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
		- Quality does not decrease
		- The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,
		- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner

	A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.

	** SPRINT PLANNING

	Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team

	Sprint Planning addresses the following topics: 

	Topic One : Why is this Sprint valuable ?
	The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint.
	The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Spring Planning.

	Topic Two : What can be Done this Sprint ?
	Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint. The Scrum Team may refine these items during this process, which increases understanding and confidence. 

	Topic Three: How will the chose work get done ?
	For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developpers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done.

	The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred as the Sprint Backlog. 

	Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint.

	** DAILY SCRUM

	The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work

	The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developpers of the Scrum Team.
	To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint
	If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers

	The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want
	The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan.

	** SPRINT REVIEW

	The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations.
	The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed

	During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review waht was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment 
	The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities.
	The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation

	The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint

	** SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE

	The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness 

	The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools and their Definition of Done. 

	The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Spring, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved

	The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. 
	The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint

	The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint

**** SCRUM ARTIFACTS

	Represent work or value 

	They are designed to maximize transparency of key information

	Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured : 
		- For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal
		- For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal 
		- For the Increment it is the Definition of Done

	** PRODUCT BACKLOG 

	The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. 
	It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team 

	Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. 
	This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size.

	The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs

		-- Commitment : Product Goal

		The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plain against.
		The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog
		The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define "what" will fulfill the Product Goal

		The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next


	** SPRINT BACKLOG

	The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (WHY), 
		the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (WHAT),
			as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (HOW)

	The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal.

	Consequently, the Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned
	It should have enought detail that they can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum

		-- Commitment : Sprint Goal

		The single objective for the Sprint
		The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Spring Backlog.

	** INCREMENT

	An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Incremments and thoroughly verified

	Multiple Increments may be create within a Sprint.
	The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism

	However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders priori to the end of the Sprint. 

	The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.

		-- Commitment : Definition of Done 

		It's a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product

		The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment.

		If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even present at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration

		If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organizations, all Scrum Teams must follow it as is minimum.
		If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product.

		The Developers are required to conform to the Defition of Done. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.
